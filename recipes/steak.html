        will help you turn a cheaper cut of meat into a truly succulent and surprisingly tender steak.<br> 
        It's very easy, quick, and will be the most delicious garlic butter steak sandwich you'll ever have.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 (5 to 6 ounce) round steak</li>

    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons high heat vegetable oil</li>

    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

    <li>1 rounded tablespoon butter</li>

    <li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>

    <li>1/3 cup beef broth or water</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley or other fresh herb</li>

    <li>1 slice French bread, toasted</li></ul><br><br>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>


<li>Diamond cut steak as demonstrated in the video, and rub both sides with oil. <br>
    Season with salt and pepper; refrigerate until ready to cook. <br>
    Place a heavy-duty sauté pan over high heat, and preheat for several minutes.<br> </li><br>

<li>Sear the steak for about 1 minute per side for medium, or to your desired doneness.<br>
     Remove the steak to a plate, turn off the heat, and toss butter into the pan along with garlic.<br> 
     Stir for about 15 seconds, and then add broth or water.<br> 
     Stir, scraping any of the charred bits off the bottom of the pan.<br></li>  <br>
<li>
Additional liquid can be added if the pan gets dry, <br>
or the heat can be turned back on to reduce if there’s too much liquid. <br>
You should end up with about 3 tablespoons of sauce. Stir in the parsley. <br></li><br>
<li>

Place the diamond cut steak on toasted French bread, and spoon over the sauce. <br></li><br><br>
