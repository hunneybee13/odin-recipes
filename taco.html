    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These crispy fried ground beef tacos are made by filling tortillas as you fry them,<br>
             folding in cheese and taco meat, then carefully opening them to dress,<br>
              with lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro. </p><br><br>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>

1 pound ground beef
</li>

    <li>

1/3 cup finely chopped onion
</li>

    <li>

3 tablespoons taco seasoning
</li>

    <li>

1 tablespoon tomato paste
</li>

    <li>

2/3 cup water
</li>

    <li>1/2 cup oil, divided</li>

    <li>

12 corn tortillas
</li>

    <li>

8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
</li>
<li>

lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro for topping
</li></ul><br><br>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>


<li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
    Add beef and cook, breaking up clumps with a spatula, until fat renders out and beef begins to brown, about 4 minutes. <br>
    Add onion and cook, stirring constantly until onion is softened and beef is crumbly, about 4 minutes. Drain fat if desired. </li><br>

<li>Add desired amount of taco seasoning and cook for 1 minute. <br>
    Add in tomato paste and water and cook, using a spoon to loosen any browned bits from the pan, <br>
    and stir until well combined. <br>
    Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. </li>  <br>
<li>
Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
Carefully place tortilla in hot oil until it begins to bubble and brown. <br>
Flip tortilla and top with 2 tablespoons shredded cheese all over. <br>
Next, add about 1/4 cup ground beef mixture on half of the tortilla. <br>
Using tongs and a spatula, carefully fold tortilla in half and cook until well browned on both sides. <br>
Drain well on paper towels. Repeat with remaining oil, tortillas, taco meat and cheese. </li><br>
<li>

Carefully open and fill tacos as desired. Serve immediately.  <br></li><br><br>
